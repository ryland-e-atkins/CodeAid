Welcome to CodeAid!

This application was created as a final project in a Database Applications class in conjunction with my friends and classmates Wesley Murray, Luke Nguyen and Dominic Peluso.

We were on a limited time constraint with the project (about a month, total) so we didn't have a lot of time to clean up the code, we just made sure it worked.

We used a LAMP stack for the application, which worked well within our requirements.

We hosted the website and database on remote server and accessed it on a local network connection so that we could keep our files consistent and all view the website as it came together.

In the coming days, I have a few things to improve upon:
-Refactoring
	-Code consistency
	-Commenting Everything
	-Double checking the security (prepared statements are implemented in 95% of the application)
	-Reducing the number of files
	-Refining the file structure in a logical way
-Things to add
	-Google and Facebook login
	-Generalize structure
	-Add transactions to support high volume of users and added security
	-Better hash function (bcrypt?) to password storage
